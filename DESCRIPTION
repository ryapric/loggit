Package: loggit
Title: Modern Logging for the R Ecosystem
Description:
    'loggit' is an effortless ndjson (newline-delimited JSON) logger, with two
    primary log-writing interfaces. It provides a set of wrappings for base R's
    message(), warning(), and stop() functions that maintain identical
    functionality, but also log the handler message to an ndjson log file.
    loggit also exports its internal 'loggit()' function for powerful and
    configurable custom logging. No change in existing code is necessary to use
    this package, and should only require additions to fully leverage the power
    of the logging system. loggit also provides a log reader for reading an
    ndjson log file into a data frame, log rotation, and live echo of the ndjson
    log messages to terminal stdout for log capture by external systems (like
    containers). loggit is ideal for Shiny apps, data pipelines, modeling
    workflows, and more. Please see the vignettes for detailed example use
    cases.
